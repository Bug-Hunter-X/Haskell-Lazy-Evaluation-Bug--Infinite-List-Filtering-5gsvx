The issue lies in the use of `filter` with an infinite list.  `filter` processes the entire infinite list, even if a matching element is found early on. To fix this, we can use `takeWhile` to limit the evaluation to a finite portion of the list, or we can use `find` which will stop after finding the first match.

Here's the corrected code:

```haskell
import Data.List (find)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let numbers = [1..]
  let result = find (
 x -> x > 10 && even x
  ) numbers
  print result -- Prints 12

  --Alternative solution using takeWhile
  let evenNumbersGreaterThan10 = takeWhile (<=20) $ filter (
 x -> x > 10 && even x
  ) numbers
  print (head evenNumbersGreaterThan10) -- Prints 12
```
This version uses `find` which stops after finding the first element that satisfies the condition. The `takeWhile` version restricts the search to a finite prefix of the list, ensuring termination. Choosing between `find` and `takeWhile` will depend on the specific needs and the context of using this type of filter operation.
