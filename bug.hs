This Haskell code suffers from a subtle bug related to lazy evaluation and the interaction of `filter` and infinite lists. The intention is to find the first even number greater than 10 in an infinite list of numbers. However, due to lazy evaluation, the `filter` function will continue to evaluate the infinite list even after finding a matching element. This can lead to unexpected performance issues or even program crashes in certain cases.

```haskell
import Data.List (find)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let numbers = [1..]  -- Infinite list of natural numbers
  let evenNumbersGreaterThan10 = filter (
 x -> x > 10 && even x
  ) numbers
  let result = find (
 x -> x > 10 && even x
  ) numbers
  print result -- This will print 12
  print (head evenNumbersGreaterThan10) -- This will not terminate
```
